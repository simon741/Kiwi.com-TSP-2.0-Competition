# Kiwi.com TSP 2.0 Competition 
My attempt to create the best feasible solution for the version of TSP in the competition organized by Kiwi.com. More about the competition https://travellingsalesman.kiwi.com/[https://travellingsalesman.kiwi.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20190207110329/https://travellingsalesman.kiwi.com/).  Basic idea of my solution: build an initial solution with constructive heuristic and then try to improve it by using simulated annealing.
